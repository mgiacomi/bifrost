# Evaluate a Bifrost Skill Design

## Purpose

Use this checklist while collaborating with a developer on a new or changed skill tree. It guides judgment; it does not replace manifest validation, tests, or topic-specific authoring documents.

Read [the skill-tree mental model](../mental-model.md) first. Consult only the topic documents relevant to the proposed tree.

## 1. Define the Mission Boundary

- What does the entry skill promise to do?
- What business input must the application developer provide?
- Can that developer understand the call from the entry input contract alone?
- What structured result, if any, does the application depend on?
- Which responsibilities are deliberately outside the mission?

Reject an entry design that requires callers to understand internal child propagation or planner mechanics merely to form a valid request.

## 2. Assign Responsibilities

- Which decisions require model reasoning, interpretation, selection, or synthesis?
- Which operations have deterministic correctness rules or controlled side effects?
- Which deterministic operations should be Java `@SkillMethod` leaves exposed through mapped YAML skills?
- Does each skill have one coherent responsibility?
- Does nesting create a useful abstraction boundary, or only add another model call?
- Could a specialist be reused without depending on hidden parent state?

## 3. Design the Capability Surface

- Which direct child capabilities does each LLM-backed skill need?
- Are those children declared locally through `allowed_skills`?
- Is the surface narrower than the global catalog?
- Does the parent depend only on direct children rather than hidden grandchildren?
- Are RBAC and execution-time access requirements compatible with every required branch?
- Could removal of a protected child make a required contract impossible for some callers?

## 4. Design Inputs and State

- Which values are ordinary business input?
- Are those values explicit in the relevant skill and tool contracts?
- For a mapped YAML skill, does the Java target's reflected input contract already express the intended public contract?
- Has `input_schema` been omitted from mapped skills so the Java target remains the single contract source?
- If a different public input shape is required, is there a separate deterministic Java adapter target rather than a duplicate or purportedly narrowing YAML schema?
- Is any trusted identity, tenant, correlation, deadline, or provenance value being delegated to the model without a framework reason?
- Is mutable global, thread-local, or session-bag behavior being introduced?
- Does evolving information belong in tool results, evidence, plans, artifacts, or traces instead?

Do not invent an undocumented propagation mechanism to reduce argument repetition.

Mapped input-contract inheritance is not parent-input inheritance. It derives one public mapped capability's contract from its explicitly selected Java target; it does not propagate values between missions.

## 5. Decide Whether Planning Is Needed

- Does the skill need an explicit task plan, dynamic decomposition, and a bounded step loop?
- If so, is `planning_mode: true` explicit?
- If not, can it use direct mission execution, including when nested?
- If a direct skill has visible children, is direct model-directed tool use sufficient without a framework-managed task plan?
- Is `max_steps` bounded for the mission?
- Can the planner complete the mission using only its visible direct children?
- Are selective branches truly alternatives, and do prompts and contracts preserve that choice?
- Does every extra planning level justify its model cost and failure surface?
- Has the design avoided adding a planning boundary merely because the skill is nested?
- Are model-compatibility claims limited to configurations and tree shapes that were actually tested?

Planning depth is not itself a quality goal. Prefer the least complex execution semantics that truthfully fit each skill's mission, while retaining planning wherever genuine decomposition or child selection is required.

## 6. Design Output and Evidence

- Which top-level output fields are claims about the mission result?
- Which claims need deterministic supportability enforcement?
- What minimum independent semantic evidence types support each claim?
- Are claim evidence lists intentionally AND-all?
- If multiple branches are substitutes, can they truthfully produce one shared semantic evidence type?
- Does `tool_evidence` name direct children of the declaring skill?
- Does successful completion of each mapped tool justify the evidence label?
- Can every contract claim be covered without forcing unrelated branches?
- Are nested child evidence details kept behind the child capability boundary?

Read [evidence-contracts.md](../evidence-contracts.md) before authoring an evidence contract.

## 7. Preserve Production Safeguards

- Is authorization enforced by the framework rather than prompts?
- Can the model override a value it should not control?
- Are tenant and resource boundaries preserved across nesting?
- Are validation failures deterministic and actionable?
- Are sensitive inputs and outputs appropriately represented in traces?
- Are timeouts, depth, tool, model-call, and usage limits appropriate?
- Is cancellation behavior important to the operations being invoked?

If the current knowledge base does not document the safeguard, verify it through [source-verification.md](../source-verification.md).

## 8. Plan Verification

- What is the smallest successful path?
- What selective alternative branches must be exercised?
- What tool or child failure should be simulated?
- What invalid input should fail before execution?
- What unsupported output claim should be rejected?
- What depth, step, or quota limit is relevant?
- What trace or journal facts prove the intended tree executed?
- Can tests assert branch and contract behavior without depending on exact model prose?

## 9. Apply the Framework Feature Lens

When authoring friction suggests a framework change, stop treating the workaround as an automatic requirement. Evaluate the request through the [Bifrost Framework Feature Design Lens](../../thoughts/framework-feature-design-lens.md).

Ask especially:

- Would the feature remain useful with a highly capable planner?
- Is it a framework responsibility or model weakness?
- Does it improve both the skill developer and entry caller experience?
- Does it introduce ambient state, mutation, implicit inheritance, or hidden precedence?
- Is the abstraction smaller and clearer than the friction it removes?
- Has the concern appeared in multiple independent skill trees?

Record recurring but unproven concerns as possible future features rather than silently expanding the framework.

## Expected Review Output

Summarize:

1. the proposed entry contract;
2. each skill's responsibility and type;
3. the direct visibility graph;
4. business input and state ownership;
5. planning boundaries and selective branches;
6. output and evidence semantics;
7. production safeguards and unresolved questions;
8. verification scenarios;
9. any friction that may signal a future framework feature.
